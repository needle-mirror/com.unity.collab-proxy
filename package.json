    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Added to the list of branches a context action to hide branches. You can use the filter to list the hidden branches and unhide them from the context menu.\n- Added to the list of branches a context action to diff the branch.\n- Added to the list of changesets a context action to create a new branch from a specific changeset.\n- Added to the check-in and shelve notification a link to go to the list of changesets/shelves. The user can also copy the direct diff link.\n- Added to the merge operation a notification with a link to go to the pending changes.\n- Added to the undo and update workspace operations an ephemeral notification.\n- Added to the status bar an action to copy to the clipboard the name of the current branch.\n- Added to most dialogs an \"Enter\" keyboard shortcut to confirm the operation like the corresponding button.\n- Added to the history of a folder a context action to revert changes.\n- Added to the history a context action to diff changes for files that were moved/renamed.\n- Added to the pending changes view the user avatar if available from Gravatar.\n- Added to the merge view the avatars for authors of changes.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the UI that could start refreshing forever, never completing the ongoing operations.\n- Fixed the auto checkout for assets to only apply for file containing actual changes.\n- Fixed project download from the Hub that was silently skipped when trying to download inside another workspace. It's now logging an explicit error in the console.\n- Fixed a null exception that could occur when switching to the changesets tab very quickly after checkin.\n- Fixed bulk editing meta files that was only performing a single checkout for the last element.\n- Fixed a null exception that could occur on Revert to this revision if the selected change triggered a domain reload.\n- Fixed the scroll that was not at the top when opening the branches or the shelves view.\n- Fixed an error that was showing when deleting a shelveset that wasn't the one selected in the list.\n- Fixed merge success notification that was showing in the view potentially colliding with contents.\n- Implemented a mechanism to fix the path to UnityYAMLMerge.exe in the client.conf so it always points to an existing Unity installation.\n- Fixed the apply shelve operation so that it checks for dirty changes and warn the user before applying the shelve.\n- Fixed Undo changes of a Moved asset using the Asset Context Menu from the Project View that was leaving an inconsistent .meta file.\n- Added the option to add a folder by path to the ignore or hidden changes list, instead of the incorrect option \"Using the item extension\".\n- Fixed incorrect branch name in the history of a file for a revision where it was moved, displaying details of the move instead of the name of the branch.\n- Fixed the Unity Editor crashing on macOS when opening the Unity Version Control window with the PiXYZ Plugin installed.\n- Fixed a null exception that occured when using the diff search filter without any shelve in the repository."
