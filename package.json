Added icons for \"Controlled\" and \"Changed\" items, removed the icon for \"Private\" items, and added a \"Contains Changes\" overlay for directories containing changes.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed applying shelves when some files cannot be checked out due to exclusive checkout lock rules. These files are now applied as local changes instead of failing the whole operation. A shelve report popup is displayed to the user.\n- Fixed the missing \"Hide\" contextual menu on the Unity Version Control button in the Unity 6.3 Toolbar.\n- Fixed incorrect tab name showing as \"Unity.PlasticSCM.Editor.x\" with no icon when upgrading a project to Unity 6.x.\n- Fixed debug log \"Package com.unity.collab-proxy version: 0.0.0\" to output the actual package version."
